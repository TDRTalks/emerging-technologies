# Emerging Technologies and Thinking Different

Today we are moving from the analog to the augmented, centralized economies to decentralized crypto currencies, and tractors to IoT and automation.

Navigating these cultural changes is challenging, even the programming languages we use are evolving. Join us as we explore the technologies that are enabling our world to become more productive. From containers to mixed reality devices, weâ€™ll try to make sense of it all and focus on what is truly important.
